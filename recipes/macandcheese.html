    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple and creamy basic mac and cheese!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until
            smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until
            mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
